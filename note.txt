### script
npm install -> npx @11ty/eleventy -> npx @11ty/eleventy --serve 
("npx run dev" dose not work)

### do not use jekyll 
.nojekyll

### github pages
recognize index.xxx -> eleventy recognizes 11 template languages
index.xxx needs to be in root dir

### when to deploy
when there is no problem on localhost(http://localhost:8081)

### problem 
- docs generate new index.html, which is not update the localhost so it does not work in local?
or Browersyncr? -> write change in src, for _site files are written from src -> and then copy index file from _site too root index file
put index.md in the root is not the right way to do!! the index.md only pretent to fix the main page 
### question
- index.html is in every directory?
- when change the main index.html, others index.html in docs will also be updated? if not, then I need to motify each indexfile manually?
